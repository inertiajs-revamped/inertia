# Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The documentation is currently in development.

## Overview

> Inertia.js-Revamped makes it possible to build server-side rendered, single-page applications using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and a UI framework of your choice. :rocket:

### UI Frameworks

<Frameworks />

<!-- * [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) -->

### Why Inertia.js-Revamped?

The article [Server-side apps with client-side rendering](https://reinink.ca/articles/server-side-apps-with-client-side-rendering), which Jonathan Reinink published on his blog in 2019 looked very promising as an alternative to [spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering). When [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) was subsequently released, it looked like the next rising star.

However, due to the lack of development, unanswered issues and rejected pull requests at [Inertia.js](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia), we decided to continue developing a fork under the name `Inertia.js-Revamped`.
