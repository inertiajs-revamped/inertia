# Inertia.js-Revamped

> A framework for creating server-driven single page apps

## Introduction

### Overview

The article [Server-side apps with client-side rendering](https://reinink.ca/articles/server-side-apps-with-client-side-rendering), which Jonathan Reinink published on his blog in 2019 looked very promising as an alternative to [spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering).  
When [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) was subsequently released, it looked like the next rising star.

However, due to the lack of development, unanswered issues and rejected pull requests at [Inertia.js](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia), we decided to continue developing a fork under the name `Inertia.js-Revamped`.

### Current Roadmap

Application Related:

* __Improve TypeScript support__ - Provide better type definitions for IDE and autocomplete
* __Improve application performance__ - Optimize the application performance and reduce required dependencies
* __Expand the test suites__ - Add test suites for better code control

Community Related:

* __Improve user & developer experience__ - Optimize the docs, examples, starter kits, workspace- and user-tools continuously
* __Collaborate with community members__ - Issue prioritization will be based on community feedback, please [share your thoughts](https://github.com/inertiajs-revamped/inertia/issues)
